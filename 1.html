    target="_blank" title="html5 specification">The HyperText Markup Language(HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>documents designed to be displayed in a <u>web</u> browser.</strong><br>
    It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br> 
    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br>
    With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.<br>
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.<br>
